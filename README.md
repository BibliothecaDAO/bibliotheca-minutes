# Process

## Meeting minutes

Any type of minute from an ad-hoc meeting that has a conclusion should
be added here for posterity,

- stating who was in the meeting,
- what was disussed, and
- the conclusion.

This way e.g. two developers can discuss and decide on something
quickly, and push a PR for the rest of the team to read. If something
comes up during the PR, then it can be caught and changed before too
much time has passed.

This allows for two developers to move quickly, while keeping the team
informed about decisions taken underway that can be reviewed without
calling a meeting with the entire team.

# Structure for minutes

1. Create a markdown file with the date
   `DD-{keywords-describing-meeting}.md` as the name, under the correct
   directory `YYYY/MM`.

2. Raise a PR to get it approved and/or discussed, and finally merged
   from some of the meeting participants.

If you would like to see an example of how a meeting minute or decision
document can look, see [TEMPLATE_MINUTES.md](TEMPLATE_MINUTES.md).
