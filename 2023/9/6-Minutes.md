- The is a failiure rate built into grants - We have to temper expectations that the will be 10 Eternum level games made.
- Once FH is live it will be upfront or simply vested grants. The is unlikely to be objective based grants.

### Developer Community Discussion
Discussion in relation to cultivating the developer experience specifically for FH projects.
- Valuable to get several heads in a room to discuss what they are up to and give feedback to one another.

- Basing hosting these projects similar to Game7 projects is a good way to plot this.
