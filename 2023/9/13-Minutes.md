## Minutes

### Loot Survivor Discussion
- Balthazar botted the game and requires updating and changing the dynamics of the game.
- Herodotus Randao will be useful and various ways to utilise Herodotus is possible.
- Utilising a starting seed to dictate entropy in the game that is unpredictable.
- Rewarding members in a 'bug bounty' style game is necessary.
- Onchain games are the most botable games in existance ever.
- Game balance discussion and changed to the LS setup.
- UI requires some fixes.

### Allocation and notes on Liquidity
- Concern in relation to liquidity depth.
- Require knowledge of the liquidity and breakdown of the LORDS split.
- Allocation can inflate supply and could cause downward pressure.
- Requirement of usage of LORDS prior to any unlocks.

### Timeline on Eternum
- Weekly sprints to develop currently.
- Unknown timeline. (No Eternum devs are on call)
- Very hard to give timeline as new developments happen all the time. Non-commital on timeline as has gave in the past and tech advancements change this.

### Utilising LORDS as an L3
- Utilising LORDS as a reliable sink to secure an L3 network.
- This would be a reliable sink of LORDS.
- Similar to the L2 setup - The network is wholesalers of Ethereum blockspace.
- Its possible with starks that offchain proving can make the entire execution layer redundant.
