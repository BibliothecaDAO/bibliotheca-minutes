## Minutes

### Rotate between the two time slots
- Previous meeting was 4am for 1337.
- The point of doing it was to rotate between the two teams.

### Public vs Private meetings discussion
- Public meetings should be public, but the DAO should be able to understand the context of what is being spoken about.
- Having an open calendar is a good idea, too.
- Not particularly good with processes and generally speaking, and with the DAO, there is the nature of it being a private entity.
- Keeping it public and completing minutes is a good solution.

### Minutes taking
- Otter.ai is an inbuilt plugin that captures every word through otter and puts it into big transcriptions. Google meetings have a similar plugin.
- Google meetings can be recorded through google meetings.

### Revenue/Capital Generation
- The objective of the workshop was to raise approximately $360,000, a six month runway.
- Considered switching out the payment from Loot Survivor to a stable, a very liquid asset.
- Option to generate revenue was to sell a golden ticket or a privilege card that would allow people to play a certain number of games per day.
- Option to sell lords' tokens into the market or through raises.
- Tournaments can raise capital.
- A short term strategic benefit to raising capital now with a fresh game in the bear market, which can drive liquidity into the Dao.
- The question goes back to if raising is not the way they are going to generate treasury and road runway, do we rely on adventurers mint?
- Problems with liquidity right now is that there is not enough liquidity.

### Tournaments
- The idea was to make the current version of Loot Survivor the canon version and add tournaments to it by a separate contract.

### Liquidity discussion
- Selling lords into the market is a possibility. People want more liq for larger participants to purchase lords so one sided liq could be an option.
- There is only so much cap to what they can get away with, and they would have to do some research into it.
- Liquidity management needs some autonomy, proposing a liquidity council or team to manage movement of liquidity.
- Consolidating all liquidity to Ekubo.

### Contributors compensation/treasury extension
- Have an agreement on day-to-day activities and scope as individuals.
- Some members have agreed to take full compensation in $LORDS.

### Pitching the idea of an nft account wallet (Similar to erc 6551)
- The 6551 standard thing that's been promoted, we can make a similar system with adventurers.
- The wallet is like any other wallet, you can spend those assets any way you want. You can refill it, or even sell the whole thing.
- There is a lot of interesting design space that hasn't been explored at all with this system.
- How much work is it to set up the arcade account mint? The timeline is unknown, but there are many unknowns.
- Weighing up the idea of if it's the thing we want to invest time and resources into, and if they feel that strongly about it.
- Another idea is to make these adventures generative like pixels and fully generative.

### Execution of an adventurer mint
- Adventure is play to die, so maybe the adventurer is a character that sits in the wallet that is almost like the adventurer master who keeps recruiting new adventures for you.
- Evolving with each action of these challenges, and how they can be traded in the future, like an account marketplace over here.
- Give them all a crown or something unique and make them all the premium ones.
- Adventures can also be displayed in an internal client. There is a place in the client for an image that can be used for adventure. Can be displayed throughout DAO based games.
- The idea of creating an adventure account with a boss who is the face of the account, and then you can keep adding adventures to this account and setting them off into different games.
- The mint can be broken into two stages, straight to artwork and then developing the account.
